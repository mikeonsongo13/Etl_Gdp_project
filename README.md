# Etl_Gdp_project
In this project, I demonstrate skills acquired through the IBM Introduction to Data Engineering  course on Coursera and create a complete ETL pipeline for accessing data from the website and processing to meet requirements.
# Project Scenario
An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the work has contracted me. I  have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and am tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since the IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated
The data is on this webpage 
The success of the code is measured by running a query on the database table to display only entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy.Also logging, the entire process execution in a text  file
